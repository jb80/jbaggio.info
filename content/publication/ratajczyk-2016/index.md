abstract: On-going efforts to understand the dynamics of coupled social-ecological
  (or more broadly, coupled infrastructure) systems and common pool resources have
  led to the generation of numerous datasets based on a large number of case studies.
  This data has facilitated the identification of important factors and fundamental
  principles which increase our understanding of such complex systems. However, the
  data at our disposal are often not easily comparable, have limited scope and scale,
  and are based on disparate underlying frameworks inhibiting synthesis, meta-analysis,
  and the validation of findings. Research efforts are further hampered when case
  inclusion criteria, variable definitions, coding schema, and inter-coder reliability
  testing are not made explicit in the presentation of research and shared among the
  research community. This paper first outlines challenges experienced by researchers
  engaged in a large-scale coding project; then highlights valuable lessons learned;
  and finally discusses opportunities for further research on comparative case study
  analysis focusing on social-ecological systems and common pool resources.
