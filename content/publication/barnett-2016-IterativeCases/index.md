abstract: "Large-N comparative studies have helped common pool resource scholars gain\
  \ general insights into the factors that influence collective action and governance\
  \ outcomes. However, these studies are often limited by missing data, and suffer\
  \ from the methodological limitation that important information is lost when we\
  \ reduce textual information to quantitative data. This study was motivated by nine\
  \ case studies that appeared to be inconsistent with the expectation that the presence\
  \ of Ostrom's Design Principles increases the likelihood of successful common pool\
  \ resource governance. These cases highlight the limitations of coding and analysing\
  \ Large-N case studies. We examine two issues: 1) the challenge of missing data\
  \ and 2) potential approaches that rely on context (which is often lost in the coding\
  \ process) to address inconsistencies between empirical observations theoretical\
  \ predictions. For the latter, we conduct a post-hoc qualitative analysis of a large-N\
  \ comparative study to explore 2 types of inconsistencies: 1) cases where evidence\
  \ for nearly all design principles was found, but available evidence led to the\
  \ assessment that the CPR system was unsuccessful and 2) cases where the CPR system\
  \ was deemed successful despite finding limited or no evidence for design principles.\
  \ We describe inherent challenges to large-N comparative analysis to coding complex\
  \ and dynamically changing common pool resource systems for the presence or absence\
  \ of design principles and the determination of “success”. Finally, we illustrate\
  \ how, in some cases, our qualitative analysis revealed that the identity of absent\
  \ design principles explained inconsistencies hence de-facto reconciling such apparent\
  \ inconsistencies with theoretical predictions. This analysis demonstrates the value\
  \ of combining quantitative and qualitative analysis, and using mixed-methods approaches\
  \ iteratively to build comprehensive methodological and theoretical approaches to\
  \ understanding common pool resource governance in a dynamically changing context."
