abstract: Research on collective action and common-pool resources is extensive. However,
  little work has concentrated on the effect of variability in resource availability
  and collective action, especially in the context of asymmetric access to resources.
  Earlier works have demonstrated that environmental variability often leads to a
  reduction of collective action in the governance of shared resources. Here we assess
  how environmental variability may impact collective action. We performed a behavioral
  experiment involving an irrigation dilemma. In this dilemma participants invested
  first into a public fund that generated water resources for the group, which were
  subsequently appropriated by one participant at a time from head end to tail end.
  The amount of resource generated for the given investment level was determined by
  a payoff table and a stochastic event representing environmental variability, i.e.,
  rainfall. Results show that that (1) upstream users' behavior is by far the most
  important variable in determining the outcome of collective action; (2) environmental
  variability (i.e. risk level in investing in the resource) has little effect on
  individual investment and extraction levels; and (3) the action-reaction feedback
  is fundamental in determining the success or failure of communities.
