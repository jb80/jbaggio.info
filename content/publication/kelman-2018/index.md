abstract: This guide is meant to help those involved in collaborative environmental
  management situations to identify the key contextual factors or elements of these
  collaborations that lead to their success or failure. As researchers, we are still
  learning about these conditions; feedback from practitioners in the field will help
  advance the knowledge about the important processes of collaboration so that key
  conditions of success can be shared more widely around the world. This guide is
  based solely on a selection of the current literature on the topic of collaborative
  management and collective action. We aim to test and enrich this list with case
  study research, to learn how context conditions these variables, and to identify
  which are the most important factors in certain contexts. It is important to note
  that not every condition must be present in a collaboration for the collaboration
  to be considered successful. Although we suggest that collaborations in which a
  large number of the listed conditions are present will likely be successful that
  may not always be the case. Practitioner comments and feedback are therefore welcome
  and much appreciated
