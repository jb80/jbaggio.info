abstract: Behavioral experiments have demonstrated that people do cooperate in commons
  dilemmas. There are alternative theories that are proposed to explain the data.
  We will use agent-based models to compare alternative behavioral theories on a series
  of experimental data of irrigation games. The irrigation dilemma captures situations
  of asymmetric access to common resources while contributions of all participants
  are needed to maintain the physical infrastructure. In our model analysis we compare
  various alternative theories, including n√§ive simple ones like selfish rational
  actors and altruistic actors. We contrast these with various alternative behavioral
  models for collective action as well as inclusion of other-regarding preferences.
  The systematic comparison of alternative models on experimental data from 44 groups
  enables us to test which behavioral theories best explain the observed effects of
  communication. We do not find that one theory clearly outperform others in explaining
  the data.
