abstract: 'Why are some governments more effective managers of resources - people,
  places and finances - and others less effective? This question is at the center
  of understanding political and economic development. Yet, established theory that
  explains how individual cognitive differences and sociological forces mutually explain
  government effectiveness is lacking. To bridge this knowledge gap we articulate
  the Functional Intelligences Proposition (FIP): The individual level attributes
  of general intelligence and social intelligence serve unique information processing
  functions and have a positive and independent effect on the ability of individuals,
  acting in concert, to govern resources. To begin to evaluate the FIP, we study the
  effects of general intelligence, social intelligence and social infrastructure (prosocial
  norms & trust) on how effectively US states govern. We find that measures of general
  intelligence (estimated by IQ) and social intelligence (social-cognitive theory
  of mind - ToM - estimated by agreeableness) have a positive and independent effect
  on the effectiveness of governance. The FIP provides an interdisciplinary explanation
  for the effectiveness of governance and, ultimately, development.'
