abstract: 'Governing common pool resources (CPR) in the face of disturbances such
  as globalization and climate change is challenging. The outcome of any CPR governance
  regime is the influenced by local combinations of social, institutional, and biophysical
  factors, as well as cross-scale interdependencies. In this study, we take a step
  towards understanding multiple-causation of CPR outcomes by analyzing 1) the co-occurrence
  of Destign Principles (DP) by activity (irrigation, fishery and forestry), and 2)
  the combination(s) of DPs leading to social and ecological success. We analyzed
  69 cases pertaining to three different activities: irrigation, fishery, and forestry.
  We find that the importance of the design principles is dependent upon the natural
  and hard human made infrastructure (i.e. canals, equipment, vessels etc.). For example,
  clearly defined social bounduaries are important when the natural infrastructure
  is highly mobile (i.e. tuna fish), while monitoring is more important when the natural
  infrastructure is more static (i.e. forests or water contained within an irrigation
  system). However, we also find that congruence between local conditions and rules
  and proportionality between investment and extraction are key for CPR success independent
  from the natural and human hard made infrastructure. We further provide new visualization
  techniques for co-occurrence patterns and add to qualitative comparative analysis
  by introducing a reliability metric to deal with a large meta-analysis dataset on
  secondary data where information is missing or uncertain.'
