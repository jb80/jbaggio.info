abstract: 'Agent based models are very useful tools for exploring and building theories
  on human behavior; however, only recently have there been a few attempts to empirically
  ground them. We present different models relating to theories of human behavior
  and compare them to actual data collected during experiments on irrigation games
  with 80 individuals divided in 16 different groups. We run a total of 7 different
  models: from very simple ones involving 0 parameters (i.e., pure random, pure selfish
  and pure altruistic), to increasingly complex ones that include different type of
  agents, learning and other-regarding preferences. By comparing the different models
  we find that the most comprehensive model of human behavior behaves not far from
  an ad hoc model built on our dataset; remarkably we also find that a very simple
  model presenting a mix of random selfish and altruistic agents performs only slightly
  below the best performing models.'
