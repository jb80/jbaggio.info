abstract: We conduct a global comparison of the consumption of energy by human populations
  throughout the Holocene and statistically quantify coincident changes in the consumption
  of energy over space and timeâ€”an ecological phenomenon known as synchrony. When
  populations synchronize, adverse changes in ecosystems and social systems may cascade
  from society to society. Thus, to develop policies that favor the sustained use
  of resources, we must understand the processes that cause the synchrony of human
  populations. To date, it is not clear whether human societies display long-term
  synchrony or, if they do, the potential causes. Our analysis begins to fill this
  knowledge gap by quantifying the long-term synchrony of human societies, and we
  hypothesize that the synchrony of human populations results from ( i ) the creation
  of social ties that couple populations over smaller scales and ( ii ) much larger
  scale, globally convergent trajectories of cultural evolution toward more energy-consuming
  political economies with higher carrying capacities. Our results suggest that the
  process of globalization is a natural consequence of evolutionary trajectories that
  increase the carrying capacities of human societies.
