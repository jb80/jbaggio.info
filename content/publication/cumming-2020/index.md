abstract: Institutions are vital to the sustainability of social-ecological systems,
  balancing individual and group interests and coordinating responses to change. Ecological
  decline and social conflict in many places, however, indicate that our understanding
  and fostering of effective institutions for natural resource management is still
  lacking. We assess theoretical and methodological challenges facing positivist institutional
  analysis, focusing on natural resource governance according to Ostrom's social-ecological
  systems (SES) framework. Rather than adding more variables, progress requires a
  clearer, more consistent approach to selecting, defining and measuring institutional
  elements; stronger links between theory and empirical research; a greater focus
  on mechanisms and causality; and the development and application of new methods,
  including quantitative approaches. Strengthening the connections between theory,
  models, and data suggests several promising avenues for advancing institutional
  analysis through the study of relationships between institutional structure, process,
  function, context, and outcomes.
