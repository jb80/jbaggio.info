abstract: Ecological disturbances (i.e. pests, fires, floods, biological invasions,
  etc.) are a critical challenge for natural resource managers. Land managers play
  a key role in altering the rate and extent of disturbance propagation. Ecological
  disturbances propagate across the landscape, while management strategies propagate
  across social networks of managers. Here we use an agent-based model to examine
  the joint diffusion of ecological disturbances and management strategies across
  a social-ecological network, accounting for the fundamental role of social-ecological
  feedbacks. We examine the management of a generic ecological disturbance as a function
  of different learning strategies and the social-ecological network. Our approach
  provides a general scaffold that can be modified to examine a variety of processes
  in which both social and ecological flows propagate across a social-ecological network.
  Our findings highlight the importance of full and accurate information to assess
  successful strategy, limited clustering and alignment between the social and the
  ecological system.
