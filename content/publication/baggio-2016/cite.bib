 abstract = {Network analysis provides a powerful tool to analyze complex influences of social and ecological structures on community and household dynamics. Most network studies of socialâ€“ecological systems use simple, undirected, unweighted networks. We analyze multiplex, directed, and weighted networks of subsistence food flows collected in three small indigenous communities in Arctic Alaska potentially facing substantial economic and ecological changes. Our analysis of plausible future scenarios suggests that changes to social relations and key households have greater effects on community robustness than changes to specific wild food resources.},
