abstract: Tree plantations have expanded rapidly at the global scale. This paper examines
  the possibilities for smallholders to engage in plantations as a potential means
  for poverty alleviation. The paper analyzes the possibilities through an empirical
  study of household tree growing in rural Vietnam, with a focus on differences in
  the capacities of households to gain land endowments and translate endowments into
  tree entitlements. Employing Heckman regression models and qualitative institutional
  analyses, the paper finds that better-off households are more likely to possess
  forestland, grow trees, and invest in plantations than poor ones. In addition, land,
  plantations, and investment tend to be larger for the better-off than the poor.
  Better-off households are in a better position to engage in tree plantations due
  to, among other factors, the institutional mechanisms differentiating household
  access to land and finance.
