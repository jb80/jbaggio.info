abstract: 'A basic premise of economics is that more secure property rights reduce
  conflict and provide an incentive for individuals to increase the productivity of
  their land. This premise underlies recent theories that food production and more
  secure property rights, by necessity, co-evolve. The argument goes like this: Dense
  and predicable resources provide an incentive for more secure property rights and
  more secure property rights provide an incentive for individuals to modify ecosystems
  in ways that increase the production of food. Here, we evaluate the effect of property
  rights on food production among ethnographically recorded hunter-gatherers. In particular,
  we use path models to evaluate a recent theory for the evolution of ownership rights
  and ecosystem management in forager-resource systems called the Niche Construction
  Model of Economic Defense. We conclude that ownership has a positive effect on food
  production strategies that require reduced coordination between individuals (such
  as planting and tending patches), but potentially has a negative effect on other
  food production strategieslandscape burning. Further, the coefficient of variation
  in rainfall and population density consistently have positive effects on the presence
  of food production. We discuss the implications of our results for explaining different
  trajectories of hunter-gatherer intensification in the archaeological record.'
