abstract: © 2018 Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences Food, energy, and water (FEW) are
  interdependent and must be examined as a coupled natural–human system. This perspective
  essay defines FEW systems and outlines key findings about them as a blueprint for
  future models to satisfy six key objectives. The first three focus on linking the
  FEW production and consumption to impacts on Earth cycles in a spatially specific
  manner in order to diagnose problems and identify potential solutions. The second
  three focus on describing the evolution of FEW systems to identify risks, thus empowering
  the FEW actors to better achieve the goals of resilience and sustainability. Four
  key findings about the FEW systems that guide future model development are (1) that
  they engage ecological, carbon, water, and nutrient cycles most powerfully among
  all human systems; (2) that they operate primarily at a mesoscale best captured
  by counties, districts, and cities; (3) that cities are hubs within the FEW system;
  and (4) that the FEW system forms a complex network.
