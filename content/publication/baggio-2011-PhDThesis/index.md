abstract: The past decade has seen an increase in interdisciplinary science and in
  the analysis of Social-Ecological Systems (SES). The study of the complex interactions
  between humans and nature is central to the understanding of our planet's state
  and to plan for the future. This thesis develops a systemic approach that uses network
  theoretical tools to analyze structural properties, agent based models to simulate
  dynamics of a system, and a resilience framework to analyze, conceptualize and discuss
  the results given by the theoretical models. A combination of models and techniques
  drawn from different disciplines is synthesised in order to develop a uniform set
  of tools which is effective for a structural analysis of SES. The first step in
  this research integrates network and resilience theory, and builds a theoretical
  model that analyzes how landscapes' structural properties affect the dynamics of
  a simple predator-prey system. The second step builds upon the first and introduces
  a “managing institution” that is able to alter the landscapes' structural properties
  according to pre-determined rules. It analyzes how human intervention influences
  the landscape network of a given system and how these properties influence the predator-prey
  system under study. The third step in this work constructs a model that analyzes
  management communities' interactions. The model aims to uncover the relationship
  between authority and management path homogenization, which influences the ability
  of the social system to proactively build resilience. Methods, techniques used,
  and the models presented in this thesis can prove extremely useful as a first assessment
  of a SES resilience. They potentially assist policymakers to make more informed
  decisions based on a combination of empirical experience and computer assisted reasoning.
  Moreover, this research contributes towards a theoretical understanding of the complex
  evolutionary mechanisms that govern a SES. II
