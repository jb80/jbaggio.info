abstract: © 2017 The Authors. Network theory is finding applications in the life and
  social sciences for ecology, epidemiology, finance and social– ecological systems.
  While there aremethods to generate specific types of networks, the broad literature
  is focused on generating unweighted networks. In this paper, we present a framework
  for generating weighted networks that satisfy user-defined criteria. Each criterion
  hierarchically defines a feature of the network and, in doing so, complements existing
  algorithms in the literature. We use a general example of ecological species dispersal
  to illustrate the method and provide open-source code for academic purposes.
