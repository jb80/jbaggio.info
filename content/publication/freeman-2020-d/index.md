abstract: On a planet experiencing global environmental change, the governance of
  natural resources depends on sustained collective action by diverse populations.
  Engaging in such collective action can only build upon the foundation of human cognition
  in socialâ€“ecological settings. To help understand this foundation, we assess the
  effect of cognitive abilities on the management of a common pool resource. We present
  evidence that two functionally distinct cognitive abilities, general and social
  intelligence, improve the ability of groups to manage a common pool resource. Groups
  high in both forms of intelligence engage in more effective collective action that
  is also more consistent, despite social or ecological change. This result provides
  a foundation for integrating the effects of cognitive abilities with other dimensions
  of cognitive diversity to explain when groups will and will not sustainably govern
  natural resources.
