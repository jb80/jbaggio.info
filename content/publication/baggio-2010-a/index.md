abstract: 'Countries rich in natural resources constitute both development failures
  and successes depending on their underlying socioeconomic fundamentals. Recent empirical
  evidence and theoretical work provide support to a resource curse hypothesis based
  on ethnic fractionalization; rivaling ethnic groups engaging in resource rent-seeking
  weaken property rights and erode institutional quality reducing hence long-term
  growth. On another front, there is increasing empirical evidence suggesting that
  ethnic heterogeneity based on polarization rather than fractionalization is a stronger
  deterrent of economic growth. In this paper, we explore the interlinkages between
  natural resource abundance and both measures of ethnic heterogeneity. In a two-simultaneous
  equation system, we assess the effects of fractionalization and polarization on
  institutions, and thereof on growth, both directly as well as interacted with our
  resource abundance proxy. We find that while ethnic fractionalization has a direct
  negative impact on the effectiveness of property rights, polarization affects institutions
  only in a resource-rich context. We find that resource wealth lowers income in ethnically
  polarized rather than fractionalized countries, a result robust to different specifications
  adopted, as well as when controlling for the direct impacts of fractionalization
  and polarization on growth. Keywords:'
