abstract: 'Achieving effective, sustainable environmental governance requires a better
  understanding of the causes and consequences of the complex patterns of interdependencies
  connecting people and ecosystems within and across scales. Network approaches for
  conceptualizing and analysing these interdependencies offer one promising solution.
  Here, we present two advances we argue are needed to further this area of research:
  (i) a typology of causal assumptions explicating the causal aims of any given network-centric
  study of social–ecological interdependencies; (ii) unifying research design considerations
  that facilitate conceptualizing exactly what is interdependent, through what types
  of relationships and in relation to what kinds of environmental problems. The latter
  builds on the appreciation that many environmental problems draw from a set of core
  challenges that re-occur across contexts. We demonstrate how these advances combine
  into a comparative heuristic that facilitates leveraging case-specific findings
  of social–ecological interdependencies to generalizable, yet context-sensitive,
  theories based on explicit assumptions of causal relationships.'
