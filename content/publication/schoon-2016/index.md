abstract: "Across the country, government agencies increasingly collaborate with non-governmental\
  \ actors on environmental dilemmas to gain access to resources, expertise, and local\
  \ knowledge; to mitigate conflict; and to share risks in a changing environmental\
  \ context. Collec- tively, these often overlapping collaborations form a complex\
  \ and dynamic governance network (GNet). This paper examines the establishment and\
  \ growth of an envi- ronmental GNet over a period of 15 years in conflict-rid- den\
  \ southeastern Arizona, USA. Using social network analysis, we detect the emergence\
  \ of several influential organizations acting as political entrepreneurs and observe\
  \ an overall change in network composition. We describe three phases: (1) a newly\
  \ emerged network, (2) a network dominated by national non-governmental organizations,\
  \ and finally (3) a shift toward local non-governmental organization involvement.\
  \ Using institutional analysis, we explore how conflict over natural resource use,\
  \ decreasing public and private monies for management, and increasing tensions over\
  \ border security, leads to the establishment of new collaborations and new network\
  \ participants. While this research focuses on environmental governance in southeastern\
  \ Arizona, this methodological approach—and insights into the key role of organizations\
  \ acting as political entrepreneurs—provides a useful starting place for ana- lyzing\
  \ networks of collaborative governance in other geo- graphic and political contexts.\
  \ Organizations' perceptions of risk and trust are keys to understanding the dynamics\
  \ of collaboration within a GNet."
