abstract: >
  Institutions are vital to the sustainability of social-ecological systems,
  balancing individual and group interests and coordinating responses to change.
  Ecological decline and social conflict in many places, however, indicate that
  our understanding and fostering of effective institutions for natural resource
  management is still lacking. We assess theoretical and methodological
  challenges facing positivist institutional analysis, focusing on natural
  resource governance according to Ostrom’s social-ecological systems (SES)
  framework. Rather than adding more variables, progress requires a clearer,
  more consistent approach to selecting, defining and measuring institutional
  elements; stronger links between theory and empirical research; a greater
  focus on mechanisms and causality; and the development and application of new
  methods, including quantitative approaches. Strengthening the connections
  between theory, models, and data suggests several promising avenues for
  advancing institutional analysis through the study of relationships between
  institutional structure, process, function, context, and outcomes.
