abstract: In recent years there has been a shift in biodiversity efforts from protected
  areas to one of interlinked habitat patches across multiple land tenure types. Much
  work remains on how managers can intervene in such systems to achieve basic goals.
  We use an agent-based model of a metapopulation with predator-prey dynamics and
  density-dependent migration to examine theoretically the capacity of a manager to
  modify the ecosystem to achieve conservation goals. We explore management strategies
  aimed at maintaining one of two goals - local or global coexistence of species.
  To achieve their goal, the manager varies the connectivity between patches based
  on one of three strategies - the monitoring of predator, prey, or the vegetation
  carrying capacity of the patches. We find that strategies that lead to highest coexistence
  monitor mid-tier populations globally. Our goal is to use our model results to advance
  decision-making in conservation beyond protected areas, typical in today's conservation.
