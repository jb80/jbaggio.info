abstract: There has been extensive empirical research in recent years pointing to
  a weak correlation between economic growth and subjective well-being (happiness),
  at least for developed economies (i.e. the so-called â€˜Easterlin paradox'). Recent
  findings from the behavioural sciences and happiness literature link this paradoxical
  relationship to negative externalities on utility imposed by social comparison (i.e.
  relative income with respect to others) and adaptation (habituation to own income
  in the past). We believe that the type of economic growth (pro-poor, pro-middle,
  pro-rich, neutral), in combination with sensitivity to social comparison and past
  income, is a key determinant of happiness trajectories and future utility levels.
  With the use of agent-based simulations we examine the long-term dynamics of subjective-well-being
  by focusing attention on the type of growth process rather than the mere size of
  income growth. We generally find that pro-middle (and balanced) growth corresponds
  to much higher levels of long-term happiness in comparison to pro-rich growth.
