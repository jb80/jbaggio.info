abstract: Landscapes are increasingly fragmented, and conservation programs have started
  to look at network approaches for maintaining populations at a larger scale. We
  present an agent-based model of predator–prey dynamics where the agents (i.e. the
  individuals of either the predator or prey population) are able to move between
  different patches in a landscaped network. We then analyze population level and
  coexistence probability given node-centrality measures that characterize specific
  patches. We show that both predator and prey species benefit from living in globally
  well-connected patches (i.e. with high closeness centrality). However, the maximum
  number of prey species is reached, on average, at lower closeness centrality levels
  than for predator species. Hence, prey species benefit from constraints imposed
  on species movement in fragmented landscapes since they can reproduce with a lesser
  risk of predation, and their need for using anti-predatory strategies decreases
