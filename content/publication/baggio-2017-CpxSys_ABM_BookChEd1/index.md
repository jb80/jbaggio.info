abstract: Agent-based modeling and numerical simulations are means that facilitate
  exploring the structural and dynamic characteristics of systems that may prove intractable
  with analytical methods. This chapter examines what are complex adaptive systems,
  when are agent-based models a useful methodology to analyze systems, what are issues
  that relate to them and where they have been applied successfully. As an application
  example, a simple model is built to analyze the movements of tourists and the relationship
  between these and the attractiveness of a tourism destination.
