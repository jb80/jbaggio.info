abstract: Governance silos are settings in which different organizations work in isolation
  and avoid sharing information and strategies. Siloes are a fundamental challenge
  for environmental planning and problem solving, which generally requires collaboration.
  Siloes can be overcome by creating governance networks. Studying the structure and
  function of these networks is important for understanding how to create institutional
  arrangements that can respond to the biophysical dynamics of a specific natural
  resource system (i.e., social-ecological, or institutional fit). Using the case
  of salmon restoration in a sub-basin of Puget Sound, USA, we assess network integration,
  considering three different reasons for network collaborations (i.e., mandated,
  funded, and shared interest relationships) and analyze how these different collaboration
  types relate to productivity based on practitioner's assessments. We also illustrate
  how specific and targeted network interventions might enhance the network. To do
  so, we use a mixed methods approach that combines quantitative social network analysis
  (SNA) and qualitative interview analysis. Overall, the sub-basin's governance network
  is fairly well integrated, but several concerning gaps exist. Funded, mandated,
  and shared interest relationships lead to different network patterns. Mandated relationships
  are associated with lower productivity than shared interest relationships, highlighting
  the benefit of genuine collaboration in collaborative watershed governance. Lastly,
  quantitative and qualitative data comparisons strengthen recent calls to incorporate
  geographic space and the role of individual actors versus organizational culture
  into natural resource governance research using SNA.
