abstract: 'Ecological disturbances (i.e. pests, invasive species, floods, fires etc.)
  are a fundamental challenge in managing connected social-ecological systems. Even
  if treatment for such disturbances is available, often managers do not act quickly
  enough or not at all. In this paper we build an agent based model that examines:
  A) under what circumstances are managers locked into non-Action that favors ecological
  disturbances? b) what learning strategies are most effective in avoiding management
  lock-in? The model we develop relates adoption of treatment strategies to eradicate
  ecological disturbances with the type of learning preferred by individuals (success
  bias, conformist and individual). We further model treatment strategy adoption as
  a function of treatment cost, ability of the ecological system to recover once treated
  and the disturbance effect on the social system. Our model shows the importance
  of success-bias imitation and system size in affecting the odds of eradicating ecological
  disturbances on connected landscapes.'
