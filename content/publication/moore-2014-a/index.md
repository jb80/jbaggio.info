abstract: Faced with numerous seemingly intractable social and environmental challenges,
  many scholars and practitioners are increasingly interested in understanding how
  to actively engage and transform the existing systems holding such problems in place.
  Although a variety of analytical models have emerged in recent years, most emphasize
  either the social or ecological elements of such transformations rather than their
  coupled nature. To address this, first we have presented a definition of the core
  elements of a socialecological system (SES) that could potentially be altered in
  a transformation. Second, we drew on insights about transformation from three branches
  of literature focused on radical change, i.e., social movements, socio-technical
  transitions, and social innovation, and gave consideration to the similarities and
  differences with the current studies by resilience scholars. Drawing on these findings,
  we have proposed a framework that outlines the process and phases of transformative
  change in an SES. Future research will be able to utilize the framework as a tool
  for analyzing the alteration of social-ecological feedbacks, identifying critical
  barriers and leverage points and assessing the outcome of social-ecological transformations.
