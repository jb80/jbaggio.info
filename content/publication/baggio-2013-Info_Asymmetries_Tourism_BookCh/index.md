abstract: 'Tourism has long been described as an information asymmetric market where
  consumers are unable to fully assess the quality of the products offered. A recognized
  consequence of this situation is that the space available for high quality products
  is greatly reduced. The diffusion of information through the World Wide Web may
  have reduced this asymmetry. Indeed, it is possible to envisage circumstances where
  consumers are better informed than suppliers about the real quality and value of
  the offerings. Using a set of agent-based numerical simulations, this chapter compares
  two possible asymmetric conditions. The results are discussed with respect to possible
  strategies to be adopted by both buyers and sellers in order to re-balance satisfaction
  (customers) and earnings (suppliers). Keywords: information asymmetry, tourism market,
  tourism experience, agent-based modeling, numerical simulations. 1.'
