abstract: The term tipping point has experienced explosive popularity across multiple
  disciplines over the last decade. Research on social-ecological systems (SES) has
  contributed to the growth and diversity of the term's use. The diverse uses of the
  term obscure potential differences between tipping behavior in natural and social
  systems, and issues of causality across natural and social system components in
  SES. This paper aims to create the foundation for a discussion within the SES research
  community about the appropriate use of the term tipping point, especially the relatively
  novel term 'social tipping point.' We review existing literature on tipping points
  and similar concepts (e.g. regime shifts, critical transitions) across all spheres
  of science published between 1960 and 2016 with a special focus on a recent and
  still small body of work on social tipping points. We combine quantitative and qualitative
  analyses in a bibliometric approach, rooted in an expert elicitation process. We
  find that the term tipping point became popular after the year 2000 - long after
  the terms regime shift and critical transition - across all spheres of science.
  We identify 23 distinct features of tipping point definitions and their prevalence
  across disciplines, but find no clear taxonomy of discipline-specific definitions.
  Building on the most frequently used features, we propose definitions for tipping
  points in general and social tipping points in SES in particular.
