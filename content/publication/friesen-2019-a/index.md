abstract: "Marine protected areas (MPAs) are important conservation tools that can\
  \ support the resilience of marine ecosystems. Many countries, including Canada,\
  \ have committed to protecting at least 10% of their marine areas under the Convention\
  \ on Biological Diversity's Aichi Target 11, which includes connectivity as a key\
  \ aspect. Connectivity, the movement of individuals among habitats, can enhance\
  \ population stability and resilience within and among MPAs. However, little is\
  \ known about regional spatial patterns of marine ecological connectivity, particularly\
  \ adult movement. We developed a method to assess and design MPA networks that maximize\
  \ inferred connectivity within habitat types for adult movement when ecological\
  \ data are limited. We used the Northern Shelf Bioregion in British Columbia, Canada,\
  \ to explore two different approaches: 1) evaluating sites important for inferred\
  \ regional connectivity (termed hotspots); and 2) assessing MPA network configurations\
  \ based on their overlap with connectivity hotspots and interconnectedness between\
  \ MPAs. To assess inferred connectivity via adult movement, we used two different\
  \ threshold distances (15 km and 50 km) to capture moderate home ranges, which are\
  \ most appropriate to consider in MPA design. We applied graph theory to assess\
  \ inferred connectivity within sixteen habitat and depth categories (proxies for\
  \ distinct ecological communities), and used novel multiplex network methodologies\
  \ to perform an aggregated assessment of inferred connectivity. We evaluated inferred\
  \ regional connectivity hotspots based on betweenness and eigenvector centrality\
  \ metrics, finding that the existing MPA network overlapped a moderate proportion\
  \ of these regional hotspots, and identified key areas to be considered as candidate\
  \ MPAs. Network density among existing MPAs was low within the individual habitat\
  \ networks, as well as the multiplex. This work informs an ongoing MPA planning\
  \ process, and approaches for incorporating connectivity into MPA design when data\
  \ are limited, with lessons for other contexts."
