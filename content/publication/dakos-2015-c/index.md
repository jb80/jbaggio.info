abstract: Connectivity refers to the structure and strength with which resources,
  species or social actors disperse, migrate or interact across patches, habitats
  or social domains. Herewediscusshowconnectivity may confer resilience to the supply
  of ecosystem services. High levels of connectivity can facilitate recovery after
  a disturbance. At the same time, highly connected systems increase the potential
  for distur- bances to spread. Additionally, the structure characterizing how system
  components are connected appears to play a role. Thus, the effect of connectivity
  on the provision of ecosystem services is highly context dependent. Despite increasing
  theoretical work that evaluates how connectivity affects the resilience of social–ecological
  systems, we still largely lack empirical studies that quantify these effects. We
  discuss this disparity and suggest new areas for further research.
