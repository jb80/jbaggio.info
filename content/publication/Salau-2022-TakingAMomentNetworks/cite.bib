   abstract = {Network-theoretic tools contribute to understanding real-world system dynamics, such as species survival or spread. Network visualization helps illustrate structural heterogeneity, but details about heterogeneity are lost when summarizing net- works with a single mean-style measure. Research- ers have indicated that a system composed of mul- tiple metrics may be a more useful determinant of structure, but a formal method for grouping metrics is still lacking. Objectives Our objective is to present a tool that can account for multiple properties of network structure, which can be related to model outcomes. Methods: We develop an approach using the statis- tical concept of moments and systematically test the hypothesis that this system of metrics is sufficient to explain variation in processes that take place on net- works, using an ecological system as an example. Results Our results indicate that the moments approach outperforms single summary metrics by adjusted-R2 and AIC model fit criteria, and accounts for a majority of the variation in process outcomes. Conclusions Our scheme is helpful for indicating when additional structural information is needed to describe system process outcomes such as survival or spread.},
