abstract: This study is the first to examine relations between general intelligence
  (g), non-g factors, and theory of mind (ToM) using structural equation modeling
  with multiple indicators of g and ToM. g was based on the subtests of the ACT, a
  college admissions test that is strongly g loaded, and ToM was based on the Reading
  the Mind in the Eyes Test and the Short Story Test (SST). g correlated strongly
  with a latent ToM factor ($β$ = .65) and moderately with the two ToM tests ($β$ ≈ .34),
  which correlated modestly with each other ($β$ = .27). The modest correlation between
  the ToM tests indicates that g predicted a small amount of variance among the ToM
  tests (7%) and suggests that the ToM tests had little in common. In addition, non-g
  residuals of the ACT subtests, obtained after removing g, correlated negligibly
  with the ToM factor and the ToM tests (|$β$| textless 0.06). Similar results were
  obtained for the ToM residuals, which correlated trivially with the ACT subtests.
  The trivial non-g effects suggest that g-ToM relations were attributable to “not
  much more than g.” The results replicated with different combinations of ACT subtests,
  controls for possible confounds (reading comprehension on the SST), and another
  college admissions test (the SAT). The use of a convenience sample (college students)
  and the limited measures of g and ToM are discussed as limitations. Future research
  should examine the robustness of effects using different measures of g and ToM and
  also examine possible mediators of g-ToM relations (e.g., executive functions).
