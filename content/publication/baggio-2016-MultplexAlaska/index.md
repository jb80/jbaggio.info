abstract: Network analysis provides a powerful tool to analyze complex influences
  of social and ecological structures on community and household dynamics. Most network
  studies of socialâ€“ecological systems use simple, undirected, unweighted networks.
  We analyze multiplex, directed, and weighted networks of subsistence food flows
  collected in three small indigenous communities in Arctic Alaska potentially facing
  substantial economic and ecological changes. Our analysis of plausible future scenarios
  suggests that changes to social relations and key households have greater effects
  on community robustness than changes to specific wild food resources.
