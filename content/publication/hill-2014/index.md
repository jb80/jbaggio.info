abstract: 'Our species exhibits spectacular success due to cumulative culture. While
  cognitive evolution of social learning mechanisms may be partially responsible for
  adaptive human culture, features of early human social structure may also play a
  role by increasing the number potential models from which to learn innovations.
  We present interview data on interactions between same-sex adult dyads of Ache and
  Hadza hunter-gatherers living in multiple distinct residential bands (20 Ache bands;
  42 Hadza bands; 1201 dyads) throughout a tribal home range. Results show high probabilities
  (5%â€“29% per year) of cultural and cooperative interactions between randomly chosen
  adults. Multiple regression suggests that ritual relationships increase interaction
  rates more than kinship, and that affinal kin interact more often than dyads with
  no relationship. These may be important features of human sociality. Finally, yearly
  interaction rates along with survival data allow us to estimate expected lifetime
  partners for a variety of social activities, and compare those to chimpanzees. Hadza
  and Ache men are estimated to observe over 300 men making tools in a lifetime, whereas
  male chimpanzees interact with only about 20 other males in a lifetime. High intergroup
  interaction rates in ancestral humans may have promoted the evolution of cumulative
  culture. Citation:'
