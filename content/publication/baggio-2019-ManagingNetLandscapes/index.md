abstract: Ecological fragmentation coupled with changes in climate affects the viability
  of species and is likely to pose a serious threat for maintaining biodiversity,
  especially as biodiversity often depends on species ability to migrate between different
  ecological areas spanning multiple sociopolitical jurisdictions. To reduce the risk
  to biodiversity, there is a need for connected, interjurisdictional landscape management
  plans at regional levels. It is a key to identify how decision-makers collaborate
  and share knowledge, learn, and ultimately make decisions affecting species coexistence.
  Here, we present a model that mimics multiple political jurisdictions making decisions
  affecting species migration across a landscape. This management and species movement
  can be between nations, between public and private landowners, or any other scale
  of interjurisdictional management in between. The model we present here has direct
  application to the decisions that managers make regularly and draws upon anecdotal
  evidence from real-world case studies such as the removal of fences in the Great
  Limpopo Transfrontier Park in southern Africa, and cooperation to solve regional
  environmental dilemmas in Arizona between neighbors. Our results highlight the importance
  of social learning and networks and matching the scale of sociopolitical and ecological
  processes in order to reduce biodiversity loss. Further, we find that close-knit
  decision-makers, especially when learning/imitating management strategies the same
  way, are detrimental to countering biodiversity loss. Finally, our results indicate
  the importance of allowing decision-makers to have room for experimental, individual
  learning to broaden the set of management strategies existing within a system to
  reduce biodiversity loss.
