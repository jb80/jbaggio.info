abstract: This book aims to shed light on the use of various modelling tools and simulation
  techniques in the domains of tourism and hospitality. It offers an essential introduction
  to the most popular methods used for modelling and simulating systems and phenomena
  of interest, and an overview of these techniques and methods. The main concept of
  each technique and method is examined and case studies and links to free online
  tutorials and other helpful resources are provided. The volume aims to encourage
  students, researchers and practitioners in tourism and hospitality to enhance and
  enrich their toolbox in order to achieve a better and more profound knowledge of
  their field.
