title: Complexity, Diversity, Cognition and Groupâ€™s problem solving ability
abstract: 'In this talk i present will present a model from first principles of cognitive abilities, diversity, and social-environmental complexity to identify the sets of conditions under which groups most effectively engage in collective action and increase their problem solving ability. We then fit the model to small groups, U.S. States, and Countries. The model illustrates the fundamental importance of understanding the interaction between cognitive abilities, diversity, and the complexity of social-environmental challenges faced by stakeholders today. Our results shed light on the ability of groups to solve complex problems and opens new avenues of research into the interrelationship between cognition, institutions.'
