title: Understanding the interplay between cognition, institutions, the environment and the build infrastructure  to further adaptability and transformability in social-ecological systems
abstract: 'The ability to adapt and transform under changing condition and deep uncertainty is key for our future. Today we are faced by significant changes in periodic challenges that we face such as increasing intensity and frequency of wildfires, hurricanes, and floods (among others) and biodiversity loss. Assessing such challenges requires a holistic understanding of the complex interedependnecies between the environment (natural), the build infrastructure (from housing to canals, from ports to seawalls), and the human system. During this presentation i will present work that is based on an interdisciplinary and multi-method approach and whose key objective is to assess how cognition and social network interact with the natural and build infrastructure. I will first present results from behavioral experiments and case studies looking at collaboration in managing social-ecological systems. Then i will present a series of models based on the experimental results and expand the discussion to assess how cognition, institutions, the environemnt and the built iinfrastructure iinteract in order to shed light on how to increase our ability to adapt and transform under changing, uncertain conditons.'
