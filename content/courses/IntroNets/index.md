title: IDS 6606 Approaches to Network Analysis and Applications
date: 2021-04-07T18:07:33.912Z
summary: Networks are ubiquitous; they can be found at every turn, from alliance formation to opinions, from rivers to species migration, from proteins to computers and the internet, from trade to disease spreading, from friendship to co-working and innovation. How entities (people, countries, proteins, species, landscapes, etc.) are linked to each other often affects how processes unfold (i.e. the resilience of food-webs, the spread of information on the internet, the ability to reduce or facilitate contagions and trade, or how opinions and ideas are shared). In other words, structure influences process, and thus the underlying network structure (how things are linked to each other) affects overall system behavior. Network structure thus helps us understand individual components and their collective behavior.

Approaches to Network Analysis and Applications IDS 6606 is a graduate level course.
It is co-taught with Dr. Wang in Computer Science and it is the core course for the
Certificate in Network Analysis and Applications at UCF. 
It is in development and will be taught from Spring 2022 (projected)

## Course Description
This course is co-organized and taught by a team of social and computer scientists in order to highlight the inherent interdisciplinary nature of network analysis. 

Basic concepts in network science, issues and best practices in collecting data and performing network analysis. Applications from multiple fields including: landscape ecology, social networks, diffusion of strategy and opinions, social-ecological networks, epidemiology, and computing. 


## Student Learning Outcomes
A student who has passed the course will be able to:
- General Knowledge
  -	Explain the meaning of networks, network classes and basic network metrics and their uses. 
  -	Apply network analysis in research, showing the relationship between structure and function in selected systems.
  -	Explain basic network properties of social, technical, and ecological systems
- Applied Knowledge 
  -	Collect network data, demonstrating best practices and explaining any relevant issues
  -	Write scripts to perform network analysis in Python and R
  -	Perform hands-on network analysis
  -	Use computational thinking for solving network-based problems
- Students will be evaluated via:
  -	Weekly discussions and exercises
  -	Two presentations (can be group presentation)
  -	One Final Essay (can be multi-authored)
