title: POS 7745 Advanced Quantitative Methods in Political Research
date: 2021-04-07T18:07:33.912Z
summary: This course is designed to introduce students to advanced topics in the use of statistical methods as well as other
methods and tools used to analyze issues in political science research. More specifically, in this course students will
learn how to use appropriate statistical software (STATA) in order to perform quantitative data analysis (linear and
logistic regression, time-series data analysis, panel data analysis). The course will also introduce students to other
potentially useful software to perform data analysis and they will be introduced to methods beyond statistical
analysis that are used in political science research such as content analysis, qualitative comparative analysis, agent
based modelling and networks.

Taught currently and each year since 2019 at UCF

## Student Learning Outcomes
In this course, our main goal are
1. To understand how to conduct and implement your own research and choosing the appropriate analysis
technique based on your general problem statement (research question) as well as data availability/needs.
2. Implement the correct analysis using appropriate software (STATA)
3. Present your findings both orally (through presentation) and written (through writing a research report).
