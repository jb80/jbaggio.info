title: POS 6729 Political Networks 
date: 2021-04-07T18:07:33.912Z
summary: The world is becoming increasingly complex and interlinked due to globalization and the advancements of technologies. In the last two decades, network science has gained traction and has been used to describe a wide variety of different phenomena in life and social sciences. In fact, it is well documented that structural properties of networks influence behaviors and outcomes in a wide range of systems - from social networks to food webs, from landscapes to power grids, from the internet to political and policy networks, not to mention epidemics and vaccines interactions, strategies and ideas, coalitions and teams.

Politcal Network Analysis (theory and applications) POS 6729 is a graduate level course taught face to face. 
Taught currently and every other year since 2018 at UCF

## Course Description
Network theory dates its conceptual origins back to the
1730s thanks to Euler (1736); but the starting point of
modern graph theory is considered to be the work of two
Hungarian mathematicians on random graphs: Erdos and
Reny in 1959 and 1960.
This course is an introduction to network theory. The course
will focus on introducing concepts, metrics and applications
in network analysis with a focus on policy networks,
collaborations and interdependent systems. The course will
also provide students with the ability to devise their own
network survey, collect data, and to do their own network
analysis in Python, via the NetworkX package. The course is
thus divided into a general lecture in which concepts and
metrics are explained to students via standard lecture
format, and a technical lecture in which students will
familiarize themselves with the analysis of Networks via
NetworkX. The course will also include introductory lectures
on how to write a script. This latter is an important
transferable skill as scripts are used in many programs used
in today world and academic environments: from SPSS, to
STATA, from Matlab to R. 
The topics covered will be the
following:
- General concepts: Networks, classes of networks,
network metrics, exponential random graph models,
multiplex networks, diffusion on networks. Applying
network theoretical tools for the analysis of policy and
political networks as well as integrated socialecological
networks.
- Technical skills: Survey instrument for devising
networks; Python NetworkX package
- Optional skills (to be discussed with the instructor):
Integrating Networks and computational modelling,
using R (sna, igraph, and ergm packages are great).

To facilitate learning, the course is divided into four
main blocks:
1. The first block of the course will introduce what are
networks, different network classes and the most
common network metrics used to analyze networks.
2. The second block of the course will focus on (best)
practices to collect data for network analysis, and
application of network analysis to real world problems.
3. The third block will focus on advanced network topics
(exponential random graph models and multiplex
networks).
4. The final block of the course will be centered on group
and individual final projects. We will work in class on
defining meaningful research questions related to
network analysis, how to gather relevant network data,
analyze networks and interpret the results. Optional
topics can be discussed with the instructor and
addressed in this third block.

## Student Learning Outcomes
Students that successfully complete this class will be able to:
- Define and understand key concepts in network science
- Use NetworkX package in Python to analyze networks
- Apply theory and methods learned to interpret and
analyze problems in their area of interest
