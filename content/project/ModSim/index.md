A model is a simplified representation of reality, and such simplifications essentially consist of discarding those details that are not strictly necessary and allowing the focus on aspects we want to understand. Simplifications are based on assumptions that may hold in some situations but may not be valid in others. This implies that a model that explains a certain situation well, may fail in another situation. No matter the technique used, assumptions must be checked before starting the modelling process. This is a collection of work that relates to modelling and simulation (with special attention to Agent Based Modelling)
